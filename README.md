# ElectionAnalysis

I was working for Greg Tanaka who is runnning for congress as a data analyst intern from June 2022 to September 2022. This Election Alalysis is what I had done as part of my interview. 
As I did this analysis, I went https://data.census.gov/ websites and got census data to combine it with election statistics in each precint. Throuout this process I was required to merge a bunch of data using pandas, but I could find some of the tendency in this election, which was great experience overall.
